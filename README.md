### This repository implements scalable, variational gaussian process factor analysis (svGPFA) in JAX.

svGPFA was originally proposed in the following paper : Temporal alignment and latent Gaussian process factor inference in population spike trains, Duncker & Sahani, Neurips, 2018

This repository reimplements the approach in JAX to obtain speedups. For a demonstration on toy data see: notebooks

To install this repo : pip install -e .

Requirements: JAX, Numpy, Matplotlib
